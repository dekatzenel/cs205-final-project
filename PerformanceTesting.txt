For the purposes of picking a number of processes to test parameter selection with, I calculated the run time for 10,000 iteration runs of parallel parallel tempering using a range of number of processes: 
1 processes: 1.4 sec
2 processes: 1.8 sec
3 processes: 2.7 sec
4 processes: 3.0 sec
5 processes: 4.5 sec
6 processes: 5.1 sec
7 processes: 6.0 sec
8 processes: 6.8 sec


4 processes was the most efficient on my computer, so I did my tests with 4 processes.  

Parallel Parallel Tempering Parameter selection:

My 'back of the envelope' calculation for optimizing the parameters for parallel parallel tempering:

I chose to do 30 runs per parameter combination to find an average performance for each combination.  This run was performed with every process and every run having the exact same starting path, which was probably not ideal, in retrospect.  

30 runs of 10,000 iterations per combination at 3 seconds each results in 1.5 minutes per combination tested.  I wished to use no more than a half hour of run time for the parameter search, so this gave me 20 parameter combinations to check.  With three parameters to optimize (ratio between temperature of each process, number of city swaps per change, and number of iterations between swap considerations), I decided that I could test 6 values for each parameter.  

The first parameter I tested was the ratio of the temperature of the processes.  Based on a suggestion from the literature ________(?), we used a constant ratio between the processes.  I tested a range of ratios between 1 (all threads have temperature=1), sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(4), sqrt(5), sqrt(6)

Best ratio to use is the square root of  5.0
Time: 599.052000046

Next, using the best temperature ratio value of sqrt(5.0), I tested a range of number of swaps per consideration.  This raged from 1 to 6.  

Best number of swaps to use is  1
Time: 649.733999968

Next, using the best temperature ratio and the best number of swaps (1), I tested a range of swap interval values.  I tested values of 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320.  

Best swapping interval is  320
Time: 437.944999933

Because this interval was the greatest value that I considered, I ran one more test, extending the range of values that I tested to 80, 160, 320, 480, and 640.  

Best swapping interval is  480
Time: 340.917999983

With some more time to dial in the best parameters, I would have done a more exhaustive search, but I deemed this exploration to be representative of the process, which could easily be extended.  I used these parameters (temp_ratio = sqrt(5.0), nswaps = 1, nbefore = 480) for the performance tests.
